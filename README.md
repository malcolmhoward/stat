# STAT - System Telemetry and Analytics Tracker

STAT is the OASIS subsystem responsible for monitoring internal hardware conditions and broadcasting live telemetry across the network. It tracks critical metrics such as power levels, CPU usage, memory load, and thermal status, then publishes this data via MQTT for consumption by other modules like DAWN (voice interface), MIRAGE (HUD), and other systems. 

Designed for extensibility, STAT serves as the diagnostic heartbeat of the suit—reporting and keeping the entire system informed and in sync.

## Power Monitoring Options

STAT supports multiple power monitoring methods:

### Auto-detection (Default)

By default, STAT automatically detects available power monitors in this order:
1. Checks for INA3221 via sysfs interface
2. Checks for INA238 via direct I2C access
3. Uses the best available monitor(s)

### INA238 Single-Channel Power Monitor

The INA238 provides high-precision voltage, current, and power measurements via I2C:
- High accuracy (0.1% typical)
- Wide common-mode voltage range
- Internal temperature sensor
- Ideal for single-source monitoring

### INA3221 Multi-Channel Power Monitor

The INA3221 provides three-channel monitoring:
- Simultaneous monitoring of multiple power rails
- Each channel reports voltage, current, and power
- Ideal for systems with multiple power sources
- Accessed via Linux hwmon interface

### Unified Monitoring

When multiple sources are available, STAT can combine data for a unified view:
- Prioritizes the most accurate source for each metric
- Combines INA238 precision with BMS cell-level data
- Provides comprehensive health monitoring

## Battery Monitoring Features

### Daly Smart BMS Integration

STAT provides comprehensive integration with Daly Smart BMS:

- **Auto-detection**: Automatically finds BMS on common serial ports
- **Cell-level Monitoring**: Individual cell voltage tracking
- **Balance Status**: Cell balancing monitoring
- **FET Status**: Charge and discharge MOSFET state
- **Temperature Sensors**: Multiple temperature sensor support
- **Fault Reporting**: Detailed fault detection and categorization
- **Health Analysis**: Cell deviation detection with severity levels
- **Configuration**: Set capacity and SOC via command line

### Battery Health Diagnostics

The battery health monitoring system:

1. Calculates cell voltage statistics (min, max, average, delta)
2. Detects deviations from average with configurable thresholds
3. Categorizes cells as NORMAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL
4. Provides detailed health status with reasons
5. Monitors cell balancing activity
6. Categorizes BMS faults by severity
7. Publishes comprehensive health data via MQTT

### Battery Time Estimation

STAT uses an advanced battery time estimation algorithm that takes into account:

1. **Battery Chemistry**: Different discharge curves for Li-ion, LiPo, LiFePO4, etc.
2. **Temperature Effects**: Reduced capacity at lower temperatures
3. **Current Load**: Actual measured current draw for accurate predictions
4. **Cell Configuration**: Number of cells in series and parallel
5. **Adaptive Smoothing**: Prevents estimates from jumping erratically

The estimation process:
1. Calculates current state of charge using chemistry-specific discharge curves
2. Applies temperature compensation to the battery capacity
3. Determines remaining capacity based on the state of charge
4. Calculates runtime by dividing remaining capacity by current draw
5. Applies adaptive smoothing based on current stability

For optimal accuracy:
- Use the correct battery chemistry and capacity
- Ensure the temperature sensor is positioned to reflect the battery temperature
- Allow the system to run for a few minutes to stabilize readings

## ARK Electronics Jetson Carrier

When running on an ARK Electronics Jetson Carrier, the application automatically:

1. **Detects the board** by reading the serial number from the AT24CSW010 EEPROM
2. **Displays the serial number** during startup and in the monitoring interface
3. **Applies optimized defaults**:
   - I2C Bus: `/dev/i2c-7`
   - Shunt Resistor: `0.001 Ω` (1mΩ)
   - Maximum Current: `10.0 A`

[STAT] Telemetry broadcast ready for OASIS network consumption
```

## MQTT Integration

STAT publishes telemetry data to MQTT topics for consumption by other OASIS components. It supports authentication (username/password) and TLS encryption.

For the complete MQTT broker setup, certificate generation, and multi-component configuration, see the **[MQTT Setup Guide](https://github.com/The-OASIS-Project/dawn/blob/main/docs/MQTT_SETUP.md)** in the DAWN repository.

### Quick MQTT Configuration

**Service mode** (`config/stat.conf`):
```bash
MQTT_HOST=127.0.0.1
MQTT_PORT=8883
MQTT_TOPIC=stat
MQTT_USERNAME=oasis
MQTT_PASSWORD=your-password
MQTT_TLS=true
MQTT_CA_CERT=/etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt
```

**CLI mode:**
```bash
oasis-stat --mqtt-host 127.0.0.1 --mqtt-port 8883 \
  --mqtt-username oasis --mqtt-password your-password \
  --mqtt-ca-cert /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt
```

### Published Data Types

- **Battery Data (INA238)**: Voltage, current, power, temperature, SOC, time remaining
- **BMS Data (Daly)**: Cell voltages, temperatures, FET status, fault conditions
- **Battery Health**: Cell statistics, deviation analysis, fault categorization
- **System Power (INA3221)**: Multi-channel power measurements
- **System Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage, fan speed
- **Unified Battery**: Combined data from all sources with prioritization

### Data Format

All data is published in JSON format with device type identifiers:

```json
{
  "device": "Battery",
  "type": "INA238",
  "voltage": 15.842,
  "current": 1.512,
  "power": 23.953,
  "temperature": 46.38,
  "battery_level": 76.0,
  "time_remaining_min": 303.5,
  "time_remaining_fmt": "5:03",
  "battery_status": "NORMAL"
}
```

### STAT Monitor GUI

For visual monitoring, STAT provides a Python-based GUI that:
1. Connects to the MQTT broker (supports auth + TLS)
2. Displays real-time telemetry in a user-friendly interface
3. Shows battery levels, cell voltages, system metrics, and more
4. Auto-detects and displays multiple data sources

Run the monitor with:
```bash
# With auth + TLS
cd tools/stat-monitor
./stat_monitor.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8883 \
  --username oasis --password your-password \
  --ca-cert /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt

# Without auth (localhost only)
./stat_monitor.py
```

4. **Network Ready**: Structured for easy integration with MQTT and other protocols
5. **Professional Display**: Clean, organized output suitable for operational environments
6. **Robust Operation**: Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation

### OASIS Integration

STAT is designed with hooks for integration with other OASIS components:

- **MQTT Publishing**: Telemetry data ready for network broadcast
- **JSON Output**: Structured data format for API consumption
- **Alert Thresholds**: Configurable limits for automated notifications
- **Historical Logging**: Data persistence for trend analysis
- **Multi-sensor Support**: Framework for additional hardware monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues

```bash
# Add user to i2c group
sudo usermod -a -G i2c $USER
# Add user to dialout for serial port access
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
# Log out and log back in for changes to take effect
```

### Build Issues

```bash
# Install required packages (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libmosquitto-dev libjson-c-dev

# Clean rebuild
rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```

### Hardware Detection

```bash
# Verify I2C bus availability
ls /dev/i2c-*

# Scan for I2C devices
i2cdetect -y 7  # For ARK boards
i2cdetect -y 1  # For generic systems

# Check device response
i2cget -y 7 0x45 0x3e w  # Read manufacturer ID from INA238

# Check serial port for BMS
ls -l /dev/ttyTHS*
ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*
```

### STAT Troubleshooting

- **No ARK Detection**: Verify `/dev/i2c-7` exists and EEPROM is accessible
- **INA238 Communication**: Check wiring, power supply, and I2C address
- **INA3221 Detection**: Verify sysfs interface available at `/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/ina3221`
- **BMS Connection**: Check serial port permissions and baud rate settings
- **Telemetry Errors**: Validate shunt resistor value and current range settings
- **Display Issues**: Ensure terminal supports ANSI escape sequences
- **Battery Time Estimate Errors**: Verify battery configuration matches physical battery
